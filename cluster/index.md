## Terminology

* Head Node
  * The server that connects a cluster to the an outside network.
* Compute Node
  * A server that is used for running computations, sometimes managed by a scheduler.
* Cores
  * A shorthand way to refer to the number of
  processor cores (usually physical) of a CPU
  in a node.

## Some Clusters At Princeton
For more detail, see:
[Computational Hardware @ Princeton](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems-and-services/available-systems)

### [Nobel](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems-and-services/available-systems/nobel)
  This cluster is most appropriate for interactive work. Any member of the
  university community can request access for their work. Two nodes (Davisson and Compton), no distinction between login/compute.

### [Adroit](https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing/computational-hardware/adroit/)
  Also available generally to members of the university community. 9 Skylake nodes with a mix of
  Tesla k20m, k40c and v100 GPUs available.

### Other Clusters
  These other clusters such as Perseus, Tiger, and Della are research
  clusters with many more nodes and GPFS networked storage between clusters.
