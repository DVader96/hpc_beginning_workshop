# Editors

[Table of Contents](/hpc_beginning_workshop/)


While you should use a version control system (like Git) for your codes, and you may want to use your own favorite graphical editor, on the server your best bet for spot changes is a text-based editor.

Here are three standard options, all of which are installed on the university research clusters.

## [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)
Nano is a continuation of pico, both of which show a lineage as being a lightweight editor for writing emails. However, it is friendly and has an interface that feels more like a modern text editor. Good first step for short jobs.

## [vi(m)](http://www.vim.org/download.php)
vi and its current iteration that `vi` usually references, vim, is a workhorse editor. It requires a steeper learning curve, but has powerful syntax highlighting that can be activated for programming. There is also a lively plugin community.

## [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
Emacs is a reliable programmer's text editor. Among its features, it can ssh to a server for you, so use it on the cluster and on your own system! Its interface also has a tremendous capacity to be customized with your own config files.
